                Deep in a bad dream<br>
                Like how you left me, I<br>
                早该学会怎么样爱惜<br>
                你的无可代替</p>

            <p><i style="color:rgb(55, 0, 236)">[chorus]</i><br>
                The way you make me feel a type of way<br>
                Feel a type of way, ah, yeah<br>
                If you are coming through will you stay?<br>
                I don't mind to wait tonight<br>
                I've been thinking<br>
                What did I do? What did I say?<br>
                I know, it's already enough<br>
                What do I do without your love, will you show me how?<br>
                Baby, give it to me now</p>

            <p><i style="color:rgb(55, 0, 236)">[verse 2]</i><br>
                I recognize, when our time is over<br>
                再见不到你踪影<br>
                日夜自由颠倒<br>
                未来也不去猜<br>
                此刻你在这就足够了<br>
                But I don't wanna stay sober so<br>
                Been here for a minute, babe<br>
                I know you wanna see me go down<br>
                All night we go on and on but do I have to let you go?<br>
                You complication, babe<br>
                But you'll never lose me, and I'm sure</p>

            <p><i style="color:rgb(55, 0, 236)">[chorus]</i><br>
                Look how you got me feel a type of way<br>
                Feel a type of way, ah, yeah<br>
                If you are coming through will you stay?<br>
                I don't mind to wait tonight<br>
                I've been thinking<br>
                What did I do? What did I say?<br>

            <p><i style="color:rgb(55, 0, 236)">[verse 3]</i><br>
                Too bad our timing<br>
                Was it love got me blinded?<br>
                等到心灰意冷只为了等一句话<br>
                You complicated it and made it too much<br>
                But you'll never (You'll never)<br>

        <p id="about"><b style="font-size:20px;">About</b><br>&nbsp;
            “Bad Dream” tells the heartbreaking story of meeting your soulmate at the wrong time in their lives, stuck in the conflict of wanting to stay together for as long as you can versus letting the person you’re in love with push you away for good.<br>&nbsp;
            Lexie told us that this vulnerable Trapsoul R&B ballad was the first demo written for The Happy Star. One night, she <b style=color:rgb(63,63,63)> “felt a stone pressing against my heart and I just had to let it out. The lyric ‘Deep in a bad dream’ came from the first freestyle take.”</b> <i>—via Pop Genius Exclusive Press Release</i><br>&nbsp;
            On July 20, 2023, Lexie released a music video for a live performance of “Bad Dream,” a collaboration with Vogue+ for its August issue inspired by the song.</p>
