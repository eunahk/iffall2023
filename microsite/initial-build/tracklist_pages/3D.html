                <p>[Intro: Jung Kook]<br>
                One, two, 3D</p>

                <p>[Verse 1: Jung Kook]<br>
                I can't touch you through the phone<br>
                Or kiss you through the universe<br>
                In another time zone<br>
                It's the only time I can't reverse<br>
                But when there's two dimensions<br>
                There's only one I'm missin'<br>
                And if you feel alone<br>
                You don't have to feel that no more</p>

                <p>[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]<br>
                I just wanna see you like that<br>
                See you like that, uh-uh</p>

                <p>[Chorus: Jung Kook]<br>
                So if you're ready (So if you're ready)<br>
                And if you'll let me (And if you'll let me)<br>
                I wanna see it in motion<br>
                In 3D (Uh-uh)<br>
                You won't regret me (You won't regret me)<br>
                Champagne confetti (Champagne confetti)<br>
                I wanna see it in motion<br>
                In 3D</p>

                <p>[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook]<br>
                'Cause you know how I like it, girl (Girl)<br>
                3D (Woo)<br>
                You know how I like it, girl (Girl)<br>
                3D (Woo)</p>

                <p>[Verse 2: Jung Kook]<br>
                Body to body to body to body to body<br>
                You and me, baby, you know that we got it<br>
                So don't go gettin' me started<br>
                'Cause you know I get hot-hearted<br>
                Baby, oh, baby, oh, baby, you makin' me crazy<br>
                Rain, rain, rain, you can't fake it<br>
                You give me brand-new emotion<br>
                You got me drinkin' that potion</p>

                <p>[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]<br>
                I just wanna see you like that<br>
                See you like that, uh-uh</p>

                <p>[Chorus: Jung Kook]<br>
                So if you're ready (So if you're ready)<br>
                And if you'll let me (And if you'll let me)<br>
                I wanna see it in motion<br>
                In 3D (Hey, show me, girl, now)<br>
                You won't regret me (You won't regret me)<br>
                Champagne confetti (Champagne confetti, hey)<br>
                I wanna see it in motion<br>
                In 3D (Come on, come on, come on)</p>

                <p>[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook]<br>
                'Cause you know how I like it, girl (You know how I like it)<br>
                3D (Hey; woo)<br>
                You know how I like it, girl (You know how I like it)<br>
                3D (Woo)<br>
                'Cause you know how I like it, girl (Oh, you know how I like it)<br>
                3D (Woo)<br>
                You know how I like it, girl (Girl)<br>
                3D (Woo)</p>

                <p>[Verse 3: Jack Harlow]<br>
                I'm on my Jung Kook, take a chick off one look<br>
                And when they get took, they don't ever get untook (Woo)<br>
                When I seen that body, you would think it was a dead body<br>
                The way I told my boys, "Come look"<br>
                I used to take girls up to Stony Brook<br>
                And steal they hearts like some crook, true story<br>
                Now when I hold somebody's hand, it's a new story<br>
                All my ABGs get cute for me<br>
                I had one girl (One girl), too boring<br>
                Two girls (Two girls), that was cool for me<br>
                Three girls, damn, dude's horny<br>
                Four girls, okay, now you whorin'<br>
                (Hey, hey, hey) I'm loose<br>
                I done put these shrooms to good use<br>
                I done put my city on my back<br>
                And the world know my name, I'm the truth<br>

                <p>[Chorus: Jung Kook & Jack Harlow]<br>
                So if you're ready<br>
                And if you'll let me<br>
                I wanna see it in motion<br>
                In 3D (Ooh)<br>
                You won't regret me (Won't regret me)<br>
                Champagne confetti (Champagne confetti)<br>
                I wanna see it in motion<br>
                In 3D (Show it to me, girl, now; why?)</p>

                <p>[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook & Jack Harlow]<br>
                'Cause you know how I like it, girl (How do you like it? Right)<br>
