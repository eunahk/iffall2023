                <p>Big Hit Music announced the 11-track album on October 3, including the previously released songs “Seven” and “3D”. Golden takes its theme from the “golden moments” of Jungkook as a solo artist.A press release further dubbed him the “Golden Maknae”, referring to his status as the youngest member of BTS with a “unique timbre that will captivate listeners worldwide”.In promotion of the album, Jungkook is set to deliver “special stage performances and making various appearances alongside the release”.The tracklist was revealed on October 15.</p>
