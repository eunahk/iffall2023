                <p class="chorus">[Chorus: Jung Kook & The Kid LAROI]<br>
                Uh, if we had the chance and the time to spend<br>
                Would you do it again? Would you do it again?<br>
                Was it too much? Uh, yeah (Too much)<br>
                Was it too much? Ayy, uh (Too much)<br>
                Now you're callin' your friends 'cause I'm gone again<br>
                When I'm back around, would you do it again?<br>
                Was it too much? Uh, ayy (Too much)<br>
                Was it too much? Uh, ayy (Too much)</p>

                <p>[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]<br>
                So tell me what got in the way<br>
                And how I thought it was good that it changed<br>
                And I'm sayin' I'm sorry again<br>
                Oh, I could never get out of my way<br>
                Hit the store and your wardrobe's replaced<br>
                And still all that you do is complain<br>
                You keep on throwin' it back in my face<br>
                And now you're tellin' me I need some space</p>

                <p class="pre-chorus">[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Jung Kook]<br>
                So I'm layin' in my bed, tripped off the shrooms now<br>
                I'll be dead before I'm without you now<br>
                Realizin' I'm addicted to you now<br>
                Come right here, baby, relax and cool down (Let's go)<br>
                What you sayin'? Hit me back with the move now (Ooh)<br>
                In my brain, no one else, it's just you now (Yeah)<br>
                Let me love you the way that I do now<br>
                I never knew how</p>

                <p class="chorus">[Chorus: Jung Kook & The Kid LAROI]<br>
                If we had the chance and the time to spend<br>
                Would you do it again? Would you do it again?<br>
                Was it too much? Uh, yeah (Too much)<br>
                Was it too much? Ayy, uh (Too much)<br>

                Was it too much? Uh, ayy (Too much)<br>
                Was it too much?</p>

                <p>[Verse 2: Central Cee & The Kid LAROI]<br>
                Am I doin' too much?<br>
                Do you understand my slang and get my sense of humor?<br>
                When your girlfriends tell you I been fuckin' 'round<br>
                Would you believe me if I told you that they lyin' and that's just a rumor?<br>
                Send you my personal driver, man, this ain't just a Uber<br>
                You know it's serious when you stay at mine and bring your toothbrush<br>
                Extra panties in your bag and some makeup removers<br>
                You know I'm hardly on my own 'cause I stay with a shooter<br>
                She call me daddy, she got issues, I am not her father<br>
                Hop off the boat, into the jet, leave the yacht at the harbor<br>
                She injectin' with Ozempic, tryna stop her hunger<br>
                Huh, I wanked before you came so I can fuck you longer<br>
                S650, chauffeur driven, just tap your address in<br>
                Pack your bags and we can board the next flight, we can check in<br>
                Make sure you check that you ain't forgot your anti-depressants<br>
                Before I fly you out again and you make me regret it (Ooh)</p>

                <p class="pre-chorus">[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Jung Kook]<br>
                Uh, it's that time, pour it up, let's take one into the head<br>
                Top down, almost crashed 'cause I'm lookin' at your texts<br>
                Back and forth, and you mad about shit I never said<br>
                Double text, no reply, but I'm knowin' that you read it<br>
                What you sayin'? Hit me back with the move now (Ooh)<br>
                In my brain, no one else, it's just you now (Yeah)<br>
                Let me love you the way that I do now<br>
