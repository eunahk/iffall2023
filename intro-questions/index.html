        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>My name is Eunah and I'm a junior studying Communication Design.</li>
            <li>I'm very passionate about illustration and I felt that the CommDes major would best support my interests. The Interaction Foundations class is required for my major and I feel that it will come in handy when I'm trying to develop my personal website later down in my career.</li>
            <li>This class will be my first experience with HTML/ CSS/ JS</li>
            <li>I hope to develop skills for making an interface that is easy to navigate while feeling satisfying to use.</li>
            <li>Designing for the screen will involve a lot more interactivity with the viewer, which makes it essential that things are easy to find.</li>
            <li><a href="https://twitter.com/home">https://twitter.com/home/</a>I like how a lot of the different functions of the website is placed on the front page and stays in place as you scroll down, which makes it very hassle-free and satisfying to use.</li>
            <li><a href="https://calendar.google.com/">https://calendar.google.com/</a> The interface for Google Calendar is very easy to understand and only includes necessary information and functions on the main page.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse/">https://www.netflix.com/browse/</a> Different genres on Netflix are neatly and compactly placed on the homepage which allows viewers to quickly scroll through to get a gist of the genres without being too overwhelmed with a huge catalogue thrown onto the screen.</li>
