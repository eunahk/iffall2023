            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift cake flour, baking powder, and baking soda, then whisk with sugar.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk egg and whole milk until well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk well. Keep the batter in the refrigerator for at least one hour to rest until the batter becomes smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat the taiyaki pan over medium-low heat and grease with neutral oil.</li>
            <li>Fill the pan mold about 60% full of batter. In the center of each mold, put 1 tbsp of sweet red bean paste and pour more batter on top to cover it.</li>
            <li>Close the lid and immediately flip.</li>
            <li>Cook for about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes on that side. Then flip and cook for another 2 to 2 1/2 minutes until golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve warm.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>* To store, keep the taiyaki in an airtight container and keep it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or in the freeze for up to a month. Toast them in a toaster oven or oven until they're crispy on the outside.</p>
